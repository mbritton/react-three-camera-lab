# React / Three.js Camera Lab


A sketchbook for ideas that'll be used in real projects. Concepts in 3D navigation explored as structures accessed via programmatic camera movements. 

These experiments (ab)use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management, [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for animation, [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for 3D (integrates [Three.js](https://threejs.org/))
